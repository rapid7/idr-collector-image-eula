Rapid7 reserves the right to change the rates, applicable charges and usage policies and to introduce new charges, listed on such Order Form upon providing Customer written notice thereof (which notice may be provided by e-mail) at least 60 days prior to the end of the then current Subscription Term.
7.2. Suspension of Service.
(a) Customer agrees that Rapid7 may suspend Customer’s access to the Service upon notice (which may be made by email or telephone) if Rapid7 reasonably concludes that Customer is using the Service to engage in illegal activity, and/or Customer’s use of the Service is causing immediate, material and ongoing harm to others. In the event that Rapid7 suspends Customer’s access to the Service, Rapid7 will use commercially reasonable efforts to limit the suspension to the offending portion of the Service and work with Customer to resolve the issues requiring the suspension of Service.

Upon such suspension, Customer shall still be liable for all payments that have accrued prior to the date of suspension and that will accrue throughout the remainder of the Subscription Term. Rapid7 will not be obligated to restore access to the Service until Customer has paid all fees owed to Rapid7. Except as expressly provided herein, termination of this Agreement by either party will be a nonexclusive remedy for breach and will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of such party.
7.3. Termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement, any Order Form or Subscription Term: (i) immediately in the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any such Order Form by the other party that is not cured within thirty days of written notice thereof from the other party, if such breach is capable of cure, otherwise immediately upon written notice; or (ii) immediately if the other party ceases doing business or is the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, that is not dismissed within sixty days of filing. Either party may also terminate this Agreement upon no less than thirty days’ prior written notice to the other party for any reason if at such time there are no outstanding Subscription Terms then currently in effect. All rights and obligations of the parties which by their nature are reasonably intended to survive such termination or expiration will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement and each Order Form.
7.4. Effect of Termination. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement or any applicable Order Form, Rapid7 shall no longer provide the applicable Service to Customer and Customer shall cease using the Service. Termination of this Agreement or an Order Form shall not relieve Customer of its obligation to pay all fees that have accrued or have become payable by Customer hereunder.
